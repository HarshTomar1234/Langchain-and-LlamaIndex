        "**Initialization**\n",

        "To use the `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` class, you need to initialize it with a search query. You can do this by creating an instance of the class and passing the search query as an argument.\n",

        "```\n",
        "from langchain.search import DuckDuckGoSearchRun\n",

        "**Running the Search**\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you have initialized the `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` instance, you can run the search by calling the `run` method. This method will send the search query to DuckDuckGo and retrieve the search results.\n",

        "```\n",
        "search_results = search_run.run()\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Search Results**\n",

        "The `run` method returns a `SearchResults` object, which contains the search results. The `SearchResults` object has several attributes, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `results`: A list of search results, where each result is a dictionary containing the title, URL, and snippet of the result.\n",
        "* `total_results`: The total number of search results.\n",
        "* `search_query`: The original search query.\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "```\n",

        "print(search_results.total_results)  # Print the total number of search results\n",
        "print(search_results.search_query)  # Print the original search query\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Configuration**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can configure the `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` instance by passing additional arguments to the constructor. For example, you can specify the number of results to retrieve, the language of the search results, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "search_run = DuckDuckGoSearchRun(search_query, num_results=10, language=\"en\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Benefits**\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` class provides several benefits, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Easy search integration**: The class provides a simple way to integrate DuckDuckGo search into your application.\n",
        "* **Flexible configuration**: You can configure the search query, number of results, language, and more to suit your needs.\n",
        "* **Search result parsing**: The class parses the search results into a convenient format, making it easy to work with the results.\n",

        "\n",
        "**An Agent Executor is a component in the Langchain architecture that is responsible for executing the actions or tasks assigned to an agent. It acts as a bridge between the agent's decision-making process and the external world, allowing the agent to interact with its environment and perform tasks.**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Agent Executor is responsible for:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Receiving tasks**: The Agent Executor receives tasks or actions from the agent's decision-making process, which are generated based on the agent's goals, intentions, and context.\n",
        "2. **Executing tasks**: The Agent Executor executes the tasks or actions by interacting with the external world, such as:\n",
        "\t* Sending requests to external APIs or services.\n",
        "\t* Interacting with users through natural language processing (NLP) or other interfaces.\n",
        "\t* Performing calculations or data processing.\n",
        "\t* Updating internal state or memory.\n",
        "3. **Providing feedback**: The Agent Executor provides feedback to the agent about the outcome of the task or action, which helps the agent to refine its decision-making process and adapt to changing circumstances.\n",
        "4. **Managing resources**: The Agent Executor manages the resources required to execute tasks, such as memory, processing power, or network connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Agent Executor is a critical component of the Langchain architecture, as it enables agents to interact with their environment and perform tasks that achieve their goals. It provides a flexible and modular way to integrate various tasks and actions, allowing agents to adapt to different scenarios and contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some key benefits of the Agent Executor include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Decoupling**: The Agent Executor decouples the agent's decision-making process from the execution of tasks, allowing for greater flexibility and modularity.\n",
        "2. **Reusability**: The Agent Executor enables the reuse of tasks and actions across different agents and scenarios, reducing development time and increasing efficiency.\n",
        "3. **Scalability**: The Agent Executor can be designed to scale horizontally, allowing it to handle a large volume of tasks and actions without compromising performance.\n",
        "4. **Flexibility**: The Agent Executor can be easily extended or modified to support new tasks, actions, or interfaces, making it a versatile component of the Langchain architecture.\n",
