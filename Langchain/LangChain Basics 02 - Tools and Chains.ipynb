    "# Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "In **LangChain**, a **chain** is an **end-to-end wrapper around multiple individual components, providing a way to accomplish a common use case by combining these components in a specific sequence**. The most commonly used type of chain is the **LLMChain**, which consists of a **PromptTemplate, a model (either an LLM or a ChatModel), and an optional output parser**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Components of LLMChain(Generic Chain):\n",
    "\n",
    "**PromptTemplate**: This is a template that helps format input variables into a structured prompt. It provides a way to organize and structure the information before passing it to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model (LLM or ChatModel)**: The model, either a **Large Language Model (LLM) or a ChatModel**, is the core component that processes the formatted prompt and generates an output based on its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional Output Parser**: This component is not always required. If provided, it takes the output of the LLM model and further processes it into a final format. This step can be useful for refining or structuring the model's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How LLMChain Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Variables**: The LLMChain takes one or more input variables, which could be anything relevant to the task at hand. In this example, it might be details about the company, such as its focus on eco-friendly water bottles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PromptTemplate Formatting**: The input variables are passed through the PromptTemplate, which structures them into a formatted prompt. This step ensures that the information is presented in a way that the model can understand and process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Processing**: The formatted prompt is then given to the model (LLM or ChatModel). The model uses its training data and algorithms to generate an output based on the input prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional Output Parsing**: If an output parser is provided, it takes the output from the model and further refines it into a final format. This step can involve cleaning up the output, extracting specific information, or organizing it in a particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Generating a Company Name**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to create a company that produces eco-friendly water bottles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would define a PromptTemplate that includes placeholders for input variables, such as \"{CompanyType}\", \"{Product}\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set the input variables with values relevant to our company, like \"EcoTech\" for {CompanyType} and \"Water Bottles\" for {Product}.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PromptTemplate formats these variables into a prompt, like \"Create a name for a company that produces {Product} for {CompanyType}.\" This structured prompt is then passed to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model generates an output based on the prompt, perhaps suggesting names like \"EcoAqua\" or \"GreenWave Bottles.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If an output parser is provided, it might further refine the output into a final format, such as selecting the most creative or catchy name from the model's suggestions."

    "article = '''Coinbase, the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, released its Q4 2022 earnings on Tuesday, giving shareholders and market players alike an updated look into its financials. In response to the report, the company's shares are down modestly in early after-hours trading.In the fourth quarter of 2022, Coinbase generated $605 million in total revenue, down sharply from $2.49 billion in the year-ago quarter. Coinbase's top line was not enough to cover its expenses: The company lost $557 million in the three-month period on a GAAP basis (net income) worth -$2.46 per share, and an adjusted EBITDA deficit of $124 million.Wall Street expected Coinbase to report $581.2 million in revenue and earnings per share of -$2.44 with adjusted EBITDA of -$201.8 million driven by 8.4 million monthly transaction users (MTUs), according to data provided by Yahoo Finance.Before its Q4 earnings were released, Coinbase's stock had risen 86% year-to-date. Even with that rally, the value of Coinbase when measured on a per-share basis is still down significantly from its 52-week high of $206.79.That Coinbase beat revenue expectations is notable in that it came with declines in trading volume; Coinbase historically generated the bulk of its revenues from trading fees, making Q4 2022 notable. Consumer trading volumes fell from $26 billion in the third quarter of last year to $20 billion in Q4, while institutional volumes across the same timeframe fell from $133 billion to $125 billion.The overall crypto market capitalization fell about 64%, or $1.5 trillion during 2022, which resulted in Coinbase's total trading volumes and transaction revenues to fall 50% and 66% year-over-year, respectively, the company reported.As you would expect with declines in trading volume, trading revenue at Coinbase fell in Q4 compared to the third quarter of last year, dipping from $365.9 million to $322.1 million. (TechCrunch is comparing Coinbase's Q4 2022 results to Q3 2022 instead of Q4 2021, as the latter comparison would be less useful given how much the crypto market has changed in the last year; we're all aware that overall crypto activity has fallen from the final months of 2021.)There were bits of good news in the Coinbase report. While Coinbase's trading revenues were less than exuberant, the company's other revenues posted gains. What Coinbase calls its \"subscription and services revenue\" rose from $210.5 million in Q3 2022 to $282.8 million in Q4 of the same year, a gain of just over 34% in a single quarter.And even as the crypto industry faced a number of catastrophic events, including the Terra/LUNA and FTX collapses to name a few, there was still growth in other areas. The monthly active developers in crypto have more than doubled since 2020 to over 20,000, while major brands like Starbucks, Nike and Adidas have dived into the space alongside social media platforms like Instagram and Reddit.With big players getting into crypto, industry players are hoping this move results in greater adoption both for product use cases and trading volumes. Although there was a lot of movement from traditional retail markets and Web 2.0 businesses, trading volume for both consumer and institutional users fell quarter-over-quarter for Coinbase.Looking forward, it'll be interesting to see if these pieces pick back up and trading interest reemerges in 2023, or if platforms like Coinbase will have to keep looking elsewhere for revenue (like its subscription service) if users continue to shy away from the market.\n",

    "In LangChain, a **Sequential chain** is a type of chain that allows you to generate text in a sequential manner, where each prompt is generated based on the previous output. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequential generation**: Each prompt is generated based on the previous output.\n",
    "2. **Chain-like structure**: The output of each step becomes the input for the next step.\n",
    "3. **Iterative process**: The model generates text in a sequential manner, with each step building upon the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial prompt**: You provide an initial prompt or input to the model.\n",
    "2. **First response**: The model generates a response to the initial prompt.\n",
    "3. **Next prompt**: The generated response becomes the input for the next prompt.\n",
    "4. **Next response**: The model generates a response to the previous response.\n",
    "5. **Repeat**: Steps 3-4 are repeated until a stopping criterion is reached (e.g., a maximum number of steps or a specific condition).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Storytelling**: Generate a story by providing a starting prompt and then using the generated text as the input for the next prompt.\n",
    "2. **Dialogue**: Create a conversation by generating responses to previous responses.\n",
    "3. **Summarization**: Generate a summary of a text by providing the original text as the initial prompt and then using the generated summary as the input for the next prompt.\n",
    "4. **Creative writing**: Use sequential chains to generate creative writing, such as poetry or short stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coherent text generation**: Sequential chains can generate coherent and context-dependent text.\n",
    "2. **Iterative refinement**: Each step refines the previous output, allowing for more accurate and relevant text generation.\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: Sequential chains can be used for a wide range of applications, from storytelling to summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging sequential chains in LangChain, you can generate text that is more coherent, context-dependent, and engaging."

    "## PAL Math Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is PAL Chain?\n",
    "\n",
    "PAL Chain, short for Program-Aided Language Models Chain, is a feature of the LangChain library. It is designed to decompose natural language problems into executable steps, generate corresponding code, and then execute this code to yield a result. This process involves a sequence of events, starting with the `**on_chain_start**` callback and ending with either `**on_chain_end**` or `**on_chain_error**`.\n",
    "\n",
    "PAL Chain requires a base language model (LLM) and a corresponding prompt to parse a user's question written in natural language.** It is particularly useful for reading complex math problems described in natural language, generating programs for solving these problems as intermediate reasoning steps, and then offloading the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features of PAL Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of PAL Chain is its ability to perform validations on the generated code using `**PALValidation**`. It also uses an expression, typically `**print(solution())**`, to get the answer from the generated code.\n",
    "\n",
    "PAL Chain also has a memory object that gets called at the start and end of every chain. This memory object is optional and defaults to None.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "While PAL Chain provides some basic guardrails such as limiting available locals/globals and inspecting the generated Python AST using `PALValidation`, these measures are not a replacement for a proper sandbox. Therefore, it is advised not to use this class on untrusted inputs, with elevated permissions, or without consulting your security team about proper sandboxing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of PAL Chain in Use\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of PAL Chain in use can be seen in a math problem scenario. Given the problem \"Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many total pets do the three have?\", PAL Chain can be used to generate and execute the necessary code to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been instances where users have encountered issues with importing PAL Chain, possibly due to recent changes in the LangChain codebase or the Palchain module. In some cases, the generated code may not be valid Python code, leading to errors when trying to run the chain."
