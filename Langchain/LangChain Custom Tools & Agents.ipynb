    "\n",
    "The `ConversationBufferWindowMemory` is a type of memory used in conversational AI agents, specifically in the Langchain library. It's a crucial component that enables the agent to keep track of the conversation history and respond accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Buffer**: The buffer refers to a temporary storage area that holds a limited amount of data. In the context of conversational AI, the buffer stores the conversation history, including the user's input and the agent's responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Window**: The window refers to a specific portion of the buffer that is currently being considered. Think of it as a sliding window that moves along the buffer as the conversation progresses. The window size determines how many previous turns of the conversation are taken into account when generating a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory**: The memory component is responsible for storing and retrieving the conversation history. It's the brain of the conversational AI, allowing the agent to recall previous conversations and adapt its responses accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a `ConversationBufferWindowMemory` instance, you can specify the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `memory_key`: a unique identifier for the memory instance\n",
    "* `k`: the window size, which determines how many previous turns are considered\n",
    "* `return_messages`: a boolean indicating whether to return the entire conversation history or just the latest message\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`, the conversational AI agent can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep track of the conversation history\n",
    "2. Respond contextually, taking into account previous turns of the conversation\n",
    "3. Adapt its responses based on the user's input and previous interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of memory is particularly useful in chatbots, virtual assistants, and other conversational AI applications where context and history are essential for generating relevant and engaging responses."

    "* `memory`: The memory component to use with the agent (e.g., `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`)\n",
    "* `verbose`: A boolean indicating whether to print verbose output\n",
    "* `max_iterations`: The maximum number of iterations to perform when generating a response\n",
    "* `early_stopping_method`: The method to use for early stopping (e.g., `generate`)\n",
